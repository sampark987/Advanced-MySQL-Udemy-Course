ANALYZING TOP WEBSITE PAGES & ENTRY PAGES

Basic SELECT *:

    SELECT * FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE website_pageview_id < 1000

Identifying all the pageview URL visits for a single user:

    SELECT * FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE website_session_id = 6

Selecting the volume of visits for each webpage:

    SELECT 
      pageview_url,
      COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) AS visits
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE website_pageview_id < 1000 
    GROUP BY pageview_url 
    ORDER BY visits DESC

    # pageview_url, visits
    '/home', '523'
    '/products', '195'
    '/the-original-mr-fuzzy', '134'
    '/cart', '56'
    '/shipping', '39'
    '/billing', '34'
    '/thank-you-for-your-order', '18'

Creating and Utilizing a Temporary Table:

    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pageview
    SELECT 
      website_session_id,
        MIN(website_pageview_id) AS min_pv_id
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE website_pageview_id < 1000 
    GROUP BY website_session_id
    
    SELECT 
      website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page, -- AKA "entry page"
        COUNT(DISTINCT first_pageview.website_session_id) AS sessions_hitting_this_lander
    FROM first_pageview
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews ON first_pageview.min_pv_id = website_pageviews.website_pageview_id
    GROUP BY landing_page

    SELECT 
      pageview_url,
        COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09'
    GROUP BY pageview_url
    ORDER BY sessions DESC

    # pageview_url, sessions

Assignment 2 - Select All Entry Pages and Rank them on Entry Volume:

    -- Step 1: find the first pageview for each session
    -- Step 2: find the url the customer saw on that first pageview


    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pv_per_session
    -- this query will return the website session ids and the first pageview id that they saw
    SELECT 
      website_session_id,
        MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_pv
    FROM website_pageviews
    WHERE created_at < '2012-06-12'
    GROUP BY website_session_id;

    SELECT
      website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page_url,
        COUNT(DISTINCT first_pv_per_session.website_session_id) AS sessions_hitting_page
    FROM first_pv_per_session
    LEFT JOIN website_pageviews ON first_pv_per_session.first_pv = website_pageviews.website_pageview_id
    GROUP BY landing_page_url;

    # landing_page_url, sessions_hitting_page
